# Student Grades Analysis Project

This mini-project analyzes student grades using R. It demonstrates:

- Data manipulation with `dplyr`
- Data visualization with `ggplot2`
- Basic statistical analysis (averages, top performers)

## Files

- `studentgrades_analysis.R` – full R code with comments
- `avg_grades_bar.png` – bar chart showing average grades per subject
- `student_avg_hist.png` – histogram showing distribution of student averages

## How to Run

1. Open `studentgrades_analysis.R` in RStudio.
2. Run the script. The graphs will be generated and saved in the folder.
